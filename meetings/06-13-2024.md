# Notes from Thursday June 6th, 2024

## Different website framework
Chase had not yet vetted how Tina CMS works in production ahead of the first meeting last week. Although it looked like Tina could make a "static" website, it actually needs a service component, and that would cause issues for long-term maintenance and overhead. Instead, we are switching to [Astro](https://astro.build), which does compile to an easily maintainable, fully static website. This repo has been recreated with a starter Astro site.

### How to get started
Similar to last week:
1. Fork this repo to your own GitHub account
1. Click green "Code" button in top right
1. Click "Codespaces button"
1. Click green "Create codespace on main"
1. Wait 3ish minutes for the IDE to boot up
1. A "Simple Browser" tab should open up and show you the website

### What if I already have a fork of the original repo?
The easiest thing to do is to go to the "Settings" tab of your fork, then find the button at the bottom to delete the repo. Then, come back to this new repo and fork it again.

## Website planning
After re-setting up the repo and IDE, we began planning for the new website. There is now an [Initial Website Development](https://github.com/orgs/pdxtroop150/projects/1) project with a list of high-level tasks we plan to dig into at the next meeting.
