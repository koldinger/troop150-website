# Notes from Thursday June 6th, 2024

Note taker: Ian Koldinger :clap:

In this first meeting we "forked" (copied) the source code repository in GitHub, set up an IDE environment to make changes, made some basic changes to our own forks (copies) of the website, and submitted the changes for review. We also discussed how websites get loaded into laptops, tablets, etc.

## Setup an IDE
* Sign into GitHub (or create an account if needed)
* Navigate to https://github.com/pdxtroop150/troop150-website
* Click "Fork" in top right and "Create fork" (fork is a seperate version that can be edited and changes can be sent to the owner for approval to be implmented using a merge/pull request)
* Click green "Code" button in top right
* Click "Codespaces button"
* Click green "Create codespace on main"
* Wait 5ish minutes for IDE(Integrated Development Envionment) to boot up
* A "Simple Browser" tab should open up and show you the website
    * Sometimes it shows an error, refresh it after a few seconds
    * You may need to click a green "Connect" button at the bottom of an initial GitHub page to get to the website
* Add "admin/index.html" to the end of the URL at the top of the "Simple Browser" tab in the IDE to play around with the Tina CMS admin interface

## Making changes and submitting them to the main repository
* Make changes as desired directly in source code files or through the Tina CMS admin interface
* See the changes in the left section bar of the IDE that now has a blue circle with a number of files changed
* Add all the files with changes you are happy with, then make a commit message and commit them
* Go to the "GitHub" section on the left section bar of the IDE (it looks like the outline of a cat in a circle) and create a "pull request" (it's a small icon, you'll just need to look around for it)
* Write a pull request message and create the pull request, syncing commits if it asks you to
* Navigate to https://github.com/pdxtroop150/troop150-website/pulls to see your new pull request
* A main repository admin will review your pull request and either pull your changes in or leave comments / questions

## How websites load
We discussed how laptops / tablets / phones / etc go from a url, like troop150.org, to finding the right server and downloading HTML, CSS, and JS for a website.

# Homework
* Find websites we like and add them to the [discussion](https://github.com/pdxtroop150/troop150-website/discussions/3) to generate ideas
* Have fun hacking changes on our forks, Chase will happily review pull request submissions if you send them out
