## Get Ready for Summer Camp

Summer camp is just around the corner, and we are gearing up for an exciting adventure at Camp Baldwin! From the [Camp Baldwin](https://cpcscouting.org/project/camp-baldwin/) website: 

> With epic excursions on horseback, wicked rides on rapids, fantastic rocks to climb and trails to ride, Camp Baldwin has it all.

We'll also have our annual summer camp pre-trip. Details are still being finalized, but it's a great opportunity for scouts to have some purely recreational fun ahead of the official Scouting America summer camp experience. Last year we biked the Route of the Hiawatha and spent a day at the Silverwood theme park, for example.

Scouts (and parents) need to complete a few steps to prepare for camp.

### 1. RSVP in Scoutbook
Make sure to RSVP in Scoutbook Plus for summer camp. You need to RSVP for each scout and adult attending. You may need to select the appropriate "View" in Scoutbook Plus to see the RSVP form for each person. The "View" is selected via the dropdown menu in the top right of the Scoutbook Plus pages.

### 2. Troop Registration
Each scout and adult attending must also register using the Troop's [registration form](https://form.jotform.com/Troop150/2025campbaldwin).

### 3. Medical Forms
All scouts and adults attending camp must have a current Scouting America medical form on file. Because summer camp is more than 72 hours long, we need the full medical form (parts A, B, and C). The medical form must be signed by a doctor. You can find the medical form [here](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/HealthSafety/pdf/680-001_ABC.pdf).

We suggest filling out the form with as much detail as you have available to you (e.g. from medical records from recent health visits), then submitting the form to your PCP for review and signature.

Next, make a photocopy of the front and back of your insurance card.

Finally, please bring a signed copy of each attendee's medical form and insurance card to an upcoming troop meeting. Only paper copies will be accepted, please do not email forms.

Health forms are only valid for one year. Please help us by submitting new health forms as soon as possible.

### 4. Payment
Most camping trips are paid by attendees afterwards because the cost can be covered by the troop. Summer camp has greater costs, so we invoice families in advance. You will receive an email invoice for the camp fees. These invoices will be reduced by the scout's previous tree fundraising earnings, if applicable. Please pay the invoice as soon as possible.

### 5. Make Sure you have the Right Gear
Check our [Summer Camp Checklist](/summer-camp-checklist) to make sure you have the right gear for camp. We also have a gear library if you want to borrow any gear. Ask any troop adult leader for more information.
