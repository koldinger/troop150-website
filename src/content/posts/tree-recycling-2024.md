## Tree Recycling Fundraiser

The calendar year ended with our important fundraising tradition: collecting christmas trees for recycling. In early December scouts hung fliers on doors in communites around the SW Portland metro area. Families could sign up to have scouts come pick up their trees after the holiday season concluded, or they could drop them off for us to haul away. The troop, in turn, asks for donations to fund annual expenses and our big summer camp each year.

We were successful once again in raising significant funds this year. Scouts worked through cold and wet conditions to hang fliers, gather trees, and haul them off. Scouts earned "shares" of the funds raised based on how many fliers they hung and how many shifts they worked during collection. Congrats to all the scouts in their efforts, and thank you to our community for your donations!
