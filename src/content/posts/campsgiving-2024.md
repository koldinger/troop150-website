## Campsgiving

If you were to go anywhere that is an hour away from Portland, Oregon, where would you go? Well we went to Camp Meriwether for Campsgiving. Campsgiving is like Thanksgiving but it's with your scout troop.

We launched pumpkins at the beach, but almost no one was actually able to get them to the sand. We launched our pumpkins and built up an apetite. We then went and had dinner, which was cooked by our very own scouts. After dinner, we had a campfire where we told stories about scars. Sometimes a rock would explode because the water inside would turn into steam, forcing the rock to break. We climbed into our dacks when it was time to go to bed.
